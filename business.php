By allowing you to apply and submit documents online, we streamline the journey from application to approval, making it easier for you to focus on growing your business.</p>
  <h4>Eligibility Criteria:</h4>
<p>Age: Applicants must be at least 21 years old, which ensures they are legally capable of entering into a financial contract and managing business finances. <br>
Business Type: Our loans are available to a diverse range of businesses, including startups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and established companies. This flexibility helps accommodate different business needs and stages. <br>
Business Duration: For established businesses, a minimum operational period of 1 year is generally required. Startups may also be eligible if they present a solid business plan and demonstrate potential for success. <br>
Revenue: Evidence of business revenue and financial stability is necessary. This can include financial statements, tax returns, or bank statements showing a steady income stream. <br>
Credit History: Both personal and business credit histories are reviewed. A strong credit history supports loan approval, though we also consider business potential and financial health. <br>
Residency: The business owner must be a resident of the country where our app operates to ensure compliance with local regulations and lending practices. <br>
